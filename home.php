        <h3>Our Brewery:</h3>
        <p>Somers Point Brewing Company is a micro brewery located in Somers Point, New 
            Jersey. Established in 2017, we have just opened our doors on April 11th, 2019.
            We are an independent craft brewery concentrating on small batch beers, with an emphasis on premium ingredients, quality and flavor. A batch is brewed as one of our “core” offerings or specialty beer brewed for a season. Upon entering our brewery, we welcome you to take a tour to learn about our brewing process and gain insight into our recipes. Please refer to the menu to view the latest selection of craft brews currently on offer. The brewery consists of a 7 barrel brewing system capable of producing approximately 217 gallons of beer per batch. The premises are open to the public for limited hours each week.</p>

        <h3>What we do:</h3>
        <p>We are, first and foremost, producers of world class craft beer. In that pursuit, the brewers of SoPo Brewing will use the finest and freshest 
            ingredients possible to produce our beers. The brewers will continually strive to improve their knowledge, skills and insights as they relate to 
            the zymurgistic arts as well as industry trends and developments. As the brewery grows, we will continue to pursue green initiatives and reduce 
            our environmental impact while maintaining our high standards for beer quality, consistency and creativity.  We will cultivate business relationships 
            with local bars, restaurants and liquor stores for retail distribution and sales of our beer, providing them with fresh, world class craft beer on a 
            consistent and reliable basis. The brewery tap room will serve our beers on a draft system that is custom designed and maintained to
            the highest standards in order to present our customers with the freshest tasting beer possible, unblemished and unadulterated from grain to glass.</p>

        <h3>Why we do what we do:</h3>
        <p>We love beer. And we love to share that passion with family, friends, and anyone else who is open and willing to raise a glass with us. From session IPAs 
            and Goses to big hairy chested Imperial Stouts and Barley wines, the infinite possibilities of flavors and experiences drives our creative passion.</p>

        <h3>Our ethos:</h3>
        <p>The proprietors of SoPo Brewing firmly believe that it is our privilege to be a part of the Somers Point community and in keeping with that belief, we pledge 
            to be exemplary corporate citizens, helping to strengthen and enhance the fabric of the community. Our core belief is that a corporate citizen who is worthy 
            of it’s neighbors and community, gives back and supports that community. This means not only being a good neighbor to those residents and businesses that are 
            physically close to the brewery, but also means that as the brewery grows and prospers, the city and community benefit from that prosperity. The practice of 
            charitable involvement and partnering with civic organizations and other local businesses to benefit the greater good of the community is at the core of our 
            ethos. We firmly believe that “a rising tide lifts all boats”, and we are committed to being an integral part of the Somers Point community. Cheers!</p>
