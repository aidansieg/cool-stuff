            <p>When we purchased the property, the current building on it was called the Ice House. It was run as an ice house during the mid 20th century but had been out of business for some time. </p>

            <h2>November 2017</h2>
            <p>After closing on the property, we started demolishing the inner structures of the building to have a clear template for our desired interior design. We didn't realize how much work was actually gonna go into reconstructing the interior.</p>

            <p>We then started to reconstruct and paint interior to make it suitable for having a bar, bathrooms, refrigerated room, and area for brewing. We aimed to do as much as possible without having to hire someone to help us out.</p>
